### For Algorithm Team

The system provides a standardized 13-feature vector matching the UCI Heart Disease dataset:

```python
# Feature vector format:
[age, sex, cp, trestbps, chol, fbs, restecg, thalach, exang, oldpeak, slope, ca, thal]

# Corresponding to:
# age: Age in years
# sex: Sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
# cp: Chest pain type (1-4)
# trestbps: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
# chol: Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)
# fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
# restecg: Resting ECG results (0-2)
# thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
# exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
# oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise
# slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1-3)
# ca: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0-3)
# thal: Thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)
```

### API Endpoints for Integration

- `GET /api/patient_data/<patient_id>` - Retrieve patient data in standardized format
- `POST /api/submit_results/<patient_id>` - Submit analysis results from AI models
- `GET /health` - System health check
