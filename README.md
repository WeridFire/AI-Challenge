# ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CAREER COMPETITION
**Task 2025: An Intelligent System for Supporting the Identification of the Presence
of Diseases**

## Introduction
Identifying the presence of diseases on the basis of parameters of a patient's health status is of
paramount importance to improve prevention and early address critical situations and, ultimately,
enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of health institutions. Recently, an increasing number of
artificial intelligence techniques have been developed to automate the processes of detecting diseases.
While these techniques bring a huge potential, it is important to keep humans in the loop when making
decisions about how to deal with the identified diseases; for example, when deciding therapies or
additional, potentially risky, analyses. In this sense, the use of LLMs (Large Language Models) is
growing not only as a way to interactively chat with humans but also as a way to naturally report to
humans about conclusions reached by autonomous systems. The proposed task aims to bring together
these two areas by developing a system that analyses a set of data relative to patients to identify the
presence of diseases and generates a human-friendly explanation of the results obtained.

## Scenario
Imagine being part of a team that builds a system that analyzes data relative to patients (e.g., consider
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) in order to identify the presence of diseases. The
conclusions must be explained to humans (e.g., to medical doctors) who are in charge of making
decisions about how to proceed.

## Goal
The task is to develop a project idea for a system that, using AI techniques, can automate the process
of identifying the presence of diseases and explaining the results to humans.

## Focus
The team must develop a solution that includes the following aspects:
1. Disease identification algorithm: It could be a classification algorithm or a regression algorithm
with a threshold to classify a patient as having a disease or not.
2. Training of the disease identification algorithm: The solution should consider preliminary
evaluation and cleaning of the available data, as well as an estimation of the computational resources
needed to train the chosen algorithm. An important aspect to account for is relative to privacy because
personal data are collected from patients.
3. Identification of characteristics of a disease: Why did the algorithm return that a particular
patient has a disease? What were the determining factors in the algorithm's decision?
4. Explanation generation: A textual report, generable using an LLM, should summarize the key
elements of the identified diseases to allow a medical doctor (not necessarily with technical expertise)
to understand the algorithm's conclusions.

## Challenge
Teams are invited to:
1. Develop a solution proposal and summarize it in 2-3 slides, including a detailed description of the
proposed solution, its benefits, and expected limitations.
2. (Optional!) Develop a prototype of a software system implementing the proposed solution. This
could be a Python notebook where the solution pipeline is sketched using the data downloadable from
the provided link (a complete and general solution is not required).
3. Prepare a 5-minute presentation to illustrate the proposal to a panel of representatives from
participating companies.

## Evaluation criteria
Solution proposals will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
1. Innovation and creativity: Originality of the proposed solution and innovative approach.
2. Feasibility and scalability: The ability to implement and scale the proposed solution, also
considering the costs of data collection, storage, and processing.
3. Presentation and communication: Clarity, conciseness, coherence, and persuasiveness of the
presentation and prepared materials.

## Available resources
Teams will have access to resources and mentoring from experts from participating companies to
guide them in developing their solutions.
